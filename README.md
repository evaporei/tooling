### dfuse Tooling

A bunch of command line tools that is used by multiple developers within dfuse.

#### Install

To install the Golang utilities, simply use `./scripts/install_all.sh`.

To install the Ruby utilities (slowly converting them to Golang please), first
install the required global dependencies:

```
gem install timeliness
```

Then add the folder's absolute path to your `PATH` environment variable.
